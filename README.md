# Loom Engine

**Loom** is a lightweight, high-performance game engine written in modern C++ with Vulkan rendering. It's designed for maximum modularity and scalability, with a strong focus on 2D games and 3D CRPG/TRPGs. Built from scratch to avoid the bloat and overhead of traditional engines, Loom is engineered for developers who care about clean architecture and silky frame rates.

> *Weave your worlds with speed and precision.*

## Status

This engine is **early in development** and not yet usable.  
Follow the repo or check back later as systems come online!

---

## Philosophy

Loom isn’t just another engine — it's a performance-first, developer-respecting foundation. It doesn’t force systems on you. Instead, you decide what gets built. Whether you're making a small 2D puzzler or a branching dialogue-heavy RPG, Loom scales to your needs without dragging along unused features.

## Features

- **Written in C++** - using minimal libraries for full control and speed
- **CMake project generation** - for clean cross-platform builds
- **Vulkan renderer** - for modern, high-efficiency graphics

---

## Planned

- **Barebones by design** - nothing you don’t need, everything you do
- **Modular compilation** - only compile the systems you need (2D, 3D, dialogue, ability system, etc.)
- **Editor coming soon** - full in-engine support for:
  - Level Editing
  - Animation Control
  - Dialogue & Quest systems
  - Visual Ability & Stat Editor (like GAS, but better)
  - No-code workflows for non-programmers

- **Future roadmap**:
  - Linux, Mac, and Mobile support
  - Console builds (eventually™)
  - Full IDE-like editor for game creation

---

## Installation & Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **CMake** (3.20 or higher recommended)
- **Python** (required for module modifications and building)
- **Vulkan SDK** (for rendering)

### Creating a Project

To create a new Loom project, run:

```bash
CreateGame.bat
```

This will set up a new project with the necessary structure and build configuration.

## Platforms

- Windows (Current)
- Linux and Mac (Planned)
- Mobile support (Future)
- Console support (Eventually)
